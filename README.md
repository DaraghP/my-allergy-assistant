## Packages/References 

### Disclaimer

For our backend, some files have been auto-generated by AWS, however contain some configurations which we may have made through AWS console that you may want to look at. There is also some boilerplate code  generated by AWS such as a blueprint for using CRUD operations in Lambda functions, which we have modified for example. There are also several other generated files such as package.json, package-lock.json, .gitignore etc.

For our frontend, some files may have been auto-generated for React Native, any .gitignore, and may have been modified by us.
